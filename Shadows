echo To the hero of Burdendale:
echo You must be ever so confused. But you must forgive me, along with us all at the end of our days. You are needed in these lands, as
echo it states in the prophecy. But we must make sure it is you, hero. It states in the prophecy that only the hero can defeat the foes in the 
echo plains of these lands. Go south, to the plains. If you can get across, we will see that you are the hero. After you have gotten across the 
echo plains, look around the sky, there will be a steady stream of smoke. There, you can find us. 
echo 									Be careful, hero.
